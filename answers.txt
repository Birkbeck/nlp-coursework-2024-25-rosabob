Question 1(d)

As the Fleisch-Kincaid (F-K) model was developed for evaluation of text for children to determine the grade level of texts, it has some limitations regarding technical aspects of adult texts. 
For example, a doctor may be very familiar with technical terms from their field like 'appendectomy', but as a 5 syllable word this may appear to F-K as a fairly complex word. 
A text containing a lot of similar words might be rated as not very readable, when in fact to the intended adult audience it is trivial. (1)

F-K also fails to give a meaningful grade-level answer if encountering a passage comprising very short and very low-average syllable sentences. 
A good example is the text "Green Eggs and Ham" by Dr Seuss, which scores a meaningless grade-level of -1.3 (2)
