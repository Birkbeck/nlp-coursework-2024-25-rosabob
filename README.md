Name: Rosa Sullivan

Academic Declaration:

“I have read and understood the sections of plagiarism in the College Policy
on assessment offences and confirm that the work is my own, with the work
of others clearly acknowledged. I give my permission to submit my report
to the plagiarism testing database that the College is using and test it using
plagiarism detection software, search engines or meta-searching software.”


Note: 

I had a problem I believe other students have also had with the pickle file being too large to store and getting into my
commit history, preventing me from pushing subsequent commits. I got a friend who uses git for work to walk me through how to 'rebase' my repo so that I could keep the rest of the history while putting the pickle file into gitignore. I think I performed it correctly and it is all fixed now but I'm still a novice with git so if there are issues please let me know as I cloned the repo before doing this and can show it if needed. Other than performing this rebase, the work is all my own.
